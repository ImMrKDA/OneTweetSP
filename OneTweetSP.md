#ONE TWEET - SUMMATIVE PRESENTATION

One Tweet is a project about typography and creating meaning with text. We were told to create a poster choosing one of the following tweets:

* **[@jack](https://twitter.com/jack/status/20): just setting up my twttr**
* **[@CIA](https://twitter.com/CIA/status/474971393852182528): We can neither confirm nor deny that this is our first tweet.**
* **[@Snowden](https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/648890134243487744): Can you hear me now?**
* [@kourtneykardash](https://twitter.com/kourtneykardash/status/11175751424): Do ants have dicks?
* **[@usher](https://twitter.com/usher/status/654335781687984129): Justice or Just Us. Is the system broken?**
* **[@edballs](https://twitter.com/edballs/status/63623585020915713): Ed Balls**
* [@LeicesterPolice](https://twitter.com/CentralLeicsNPA/status/287937337781002240): Not a scam: If youâ€™ve committed a burglary in the #Leicester area within the last week - come to our #police station & claim a FREE iPad.

The ones that are in bold are the ones that I chose. I'm going to start with the less successful one and finish with the most successful following everyone's opinion in class and my own opinion.

I'm going to try to explain what message the poster is trying to give. When I saw this tweet the first thing that came to my mind was the idea of doing something that is related to the sign up page on twitter, basically when you first open a twitter account.  

I went to the twitter sign up page and I used the questions Twitter asks you when you are signing up. I put those questions in the poster and next to them as the answers I put the _tweet_. As I said, the idea was to give the sense of that someone was setting up their twitter account. As a background colour I used a gradient of the colours of the sign up page on twitter. I think this was the less successful one because the font wasn't the best choice, and the idea wasn't giving the message I wanted to give. It was a bit confusing for my classmates to get the idea of the poster and when it comes to make art you have to give a message straight away without having to explain what it mean too much.

###We can neither confirm nor deny that this is our first tweet.

This was the first poster I did when I started this project. I really like it because it's the first thing that I created on Illustrator. Back then, I had never used Illustrator before so this was the first challenge I had to meet when I started this project.  

The idea was to highlight the words "confirm" and "deny". To do that, I made them bigger than the other words and I changed their colours into ones that could be related to the meaning of the word itself. For example, green for "confirm" and red for "deny". I didn't want to leave it just like that so I decided to play with shapes what I can put within those two words. I thought of shapes that, again, are related to the meaning of the words "confirm" and  "deny". For the word "confirm" I used a _tick_ and for the word "deny" I used an _X_. With those two elements within the words "confirm" and "deny" I was trying to highlight those two words more and make a good poster. Something that I don't like of the poster and the class agreed with me in this point is that, there isn't a good organisation of the sentences and the words. You can clearly see the two main words but the sentences are not really in the right spot and therefore the poster looks a bit unorganised.
