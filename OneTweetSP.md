#ONE TWEET - SUMMATIVE PRESENTATION

One Tweet is a project about typography and creating meaning with text. We were told to create a poster choosing one of the following tweets:

* **[@jack](https://twitter.com/jack/status/20): just setting up my twttr**
* **[@CIA](https://twitter.com/CIA/status/474971393852182528): We can neither confirm nor deny that this is our first tweet.**
* **[@Snowden](https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/648890134243487744): Can you hear me now?**
* [@kourtneykardash](https://twitter.com/kourtneykardash/status/11175751424): Do ants have dicks?
* **[@usher](https://twitter.com/usher/status/654335781687984129): Justice or Just Us. Is the system broken?**
* **[@edballs](https://twitter.com/edballs/status/63623585020915713): Ed Balls**
* [@LeicesterPolice](https://twitter.com/CentralLeicsNPA/status/287937337781002240): Not a scam: If youâ€™ve committed a burglary in the #Leicester area within the last week - come to our #police station & claim a FREE iPad.

The ones that are in bold are the ones that I chose. I'm going to start with the less successful one and finish with the most successful following everyone's opinion in class and my own opinion.
