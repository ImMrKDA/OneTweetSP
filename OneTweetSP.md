#ONE TWEET - SUMMMATIVE PRESENTATION

One Tweet is a project about typography and creating meaning with text. We were told to create a poster choosing one of the following tweets:

* **@jack: just setting up my twttr**
* **@CIA: We can neither confirm nor deny that this is our first tweet.**
* **@Snowden: Can you hear me now?**
* @kourtneykardash: Do ants have dicks?
* **@usher: Justice or Just Us. Is the system broken?**
* **@edballs: Ed Balls**
* @LeicesterPolice: Not a scam: If youâ€™ve committed a burglary in the #Leicester area within the last week - come to our #police station & claim a FREE iPad.

The ones that are in bold are the ones that I chose.
